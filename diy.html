        </h1>
        <ul class="advantages-list">
            <li><strong>Lower Installation Costs:</strong> The cost of installing a central AC in the LA metro area ranges from $23,000 to $30,000. In contrast, mini-split systems are significantly cheaper, often costing between $2,000 and $7,000 per unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Mini-split systems offer higher energy efficiency due to their inverter technology, which adjusts the compressor speed to maintain the desired temperature, leading to lower electricity bills.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone Cooling:</strong> Mini-split ACs allow for zone cooling, meaning you can cool only the rooms you use, avoiding the energy waste of cooling the entire home.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Energy Loss:</strong> Central AC systems can lose energy through the ductwork. Mini-split systems have no ducts, which eliminates this energy loss and increases overall efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Installation:</strong> Mini-split systems can be installed in various locations without the need for extensive ductwork, making them ideal for homes without existing ducts or those with limited space.</li>
            <li><strong>Quiet Operation:</strong> Mini-split units are typically quieter than central AC systems, providing a more comfortable living environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Individual Temperature Control:</strong> Each indoor unit of a mini-split system can be controlled independently, allowing for customized comfort in different rooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Maintenance Costs:</strong> Mini-split systems generally require less maintenance than central AC systems, which need regular duct cleaning and more extensive servicing.</li>
